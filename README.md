## 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

This is the first homework assignment for the Full Stack Developer bootcamp. This week we got familiar with frontend web development languages HTML and CSS. This homework is to demonstrate the technical coding capability andmaking the code accessibile.

My assignment is to take an existing website and refactor it while adhering to the Semantic HTML standards. According to [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) "A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer."

* figure
* footer
* header
* main
* mark
* nav
* section
* summary

## Fix-Broken-Links 

One of the links in the header was not working.


## Images

Images used on the webpage are to be resizerd in order to improve performance. Master iamges are available as backup in case they are to be reused. When it comes to image size, bigger isn't always better, as uploading multiple large images can affect site performance. Since the site contains multiple images, They have been optimized for faster performance.
